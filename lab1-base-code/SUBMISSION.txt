ENSC 453/894 Lab 3 - Submission Checklist
=========================================

REQUIREMENTS VERIFICATION:
[2] Load-compute-store + buffering    - load_input_tile, compute_tile, store_output_tile
[1] Pipelined load/store              - PIPELINE II=1 on load/store (no memcpy)
[3] Compute optimization              - PIPELINE, UNROLL, ARRAY_PARTITION on compute
[1] Testbench + run_hls.tcl           - mm_tb.cpp, run_hls.tcl in c-sim and co-sim
[3] Performance competition           - Must pass c-sim, synthesis, co-sim

CONFIGURATIONS:
- c-sim: 4096x4096 matrix, 64x64 buffer (run from lab1-base-code dir)
- co-sim: 32x32 matrix, 16x16 buffer

CONSTRAINTS: No Ping-Pong, no memory coalescing, ≤60% resources, 300 MHz target

BEFORE SUBMISSION:
1. Re-run HLS to verify with optimized code:
   source setup_vitis.sh
   vitis_hls -f c-sim/run_hls.tcl
   vitis_hls -f co-sim/run_hls.tcl

2. Clean build artifacts (TA will re-run synthesis):
   rm -rf c-sim/proj_csim c-sim/vitis_hls.log
   rm -rf co-sim/proj_cosim co-sim/vitis_hls.log

3. Add lab_report.pdf (speedup + resource use per optimization)

4. Zip (from ENSC453_LAB3 directory):
   cd /path/to/ENSC453_LAB3
   mv lab1-base-code YOUR_LAB_GROUP
   zip -r YOUR_LAB_GROUP.zip YOUR_LAB_GROUP

SUBMIT: YOUR_LAB_GROUP.zip on Canvas
